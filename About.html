    <p>I am Dennis dela Rosa. Happily Married and just had my first Baby</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
I was an Under Graduate of Culinary Art Student At Holy Angel University, and Now Taking Up BSIT with the Specialization in Web Development. I choose this course because <br>I am facinated on how websites works and how they were made. Upon taking this couse I am hoping that i could launce my very own website soon.



    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
<li>Watching Anime's</li>
<li>Reading Manga's</li>
<p>I am really fond of anime's and manga's, it is like an escape route for me<br> on this reality that we have.
    i really am a fan of One piece created by Mr Eiichiro Oda. The thing that <br>
    i love about One Piece is The Story of friendship and an never Ending adventure.</p>
